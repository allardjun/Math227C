%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Many processes, including the spread of an infectious disease through a small community, can be modeled as first-order exponential processes like 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dY}{dt} = \left(R-1\right) Y \quad Y(0)=1
\end{equation*}
where $R$ is a constant. This will either lead to exponential growth or exponential decay.

Assume instead that $R$ is a random variable that is different for each community. Assume it has Gaussian distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation $\sigma$,
\begin{equation*}
p_R(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}}\, e^{-\left(r-1\right)^2/2\sigma^2}.
\end{equation*}

Find the probability density function $p_Y(y,t)$ of $Y(t)$.

Intuitively, we expect half of the trajectories to grow exponentially, and half of the trajectories to decay exponentially. 

Sketch or plot the probability density you found for $p_Y(y,t)$. Does it agree with your intuition?
